## Development


```bash
$ go run ./scripts/index/*.go -dest=".index" "$GOPATH" "/usr/local/go"
```

```bash
$ go run main.go
```

_Requires a least `go1.11` (for go modules support) and `git` to be installed._

_Replace `go` with [`gin`](https://github.com/codegangsta/gin) for auto-restarts._

##

Tests are run using the standard go test command (`go test ./...`).
